## What is this?

Audio Snipping Tool is a program that records audio that your computer is playing and lets you instantly drag and drop it into any folder or other program (such as Discord) as a WAV or MP3. It's the audio equivalent of the Windows Snipping Tool.

## How to use it

Click the "Record New" button to start recording audio that your computer is playing. The status bar along the bottom of the window will display how long you have been recording for. The program will not start recording until your computer starts playing audio.

Click the "Stop" button to stop recording audio. The waveform and spectrum of the recorded audio will be displayed in the center of the window, and you can click and drag in here to select what region of audio you want to export. If you want to select the entire recording, just left- or right-click once in the waveform view without dragging.

You can click the "Listen" button to play back just the selected section of the recording if you want to hear what was captured.

The recorded audio can be normalized (volume increased or decreased) to 25%, 50%, or 100% of the maximum possible volume by clicking on the small button to the right of the "Listen" button. A drop-down menu will appear where the level of normalization can be selected. *(This operation cannot be undone!)*

To export your recording to another program or folder, simply drag the "Export" button out of the window and into the program/folder you want to copy the audio file to. You can also type in the filename that the audio selection will be exported as, and select what format it will be encoded in (WAV, 320kbps MP3, or 192kbps MP3) using the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.
