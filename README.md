# Audio Snipping Tool by Frost Sheridan

## What is this?

Audio Snipping Tool is a program that records audio that your computer is playing and lets you instantly drag and drop it into any folder or other program (such as Discord) as a WAV or 320kbps MP3. It's the audio equivalent of the Windows Snipping Tool.

## How to use it

Click the "Record New" button to start recording audio that your computer is playing. The status bar along the bottom of the window will display how long you have been recording for. The program will not start recording until your computer starts playing audio.

Click the "Stop" button to stop recording audio. The waveform of the recorded audio will be displayed in the center of the window, and you can click and drag in here to select what region of audio you want to export. If you want to select the entire recording, just left- or right-click once in the waveform view without dragging.

You can click the "Listen" button to play back just the selected section of the recording if you want to hear what was captured.

To export your recording to another program or folder, first select whether you want to export in WAV or MP3 format (by clicking the "Export as:" buttons), then just drag the "Export" button from Audio Snipping Tool and drop it into another program or folder.
